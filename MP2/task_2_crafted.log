prompt:
You are an AI programming assistant. Generate a comprehensive pytest test suite including at least 10 test cases for the following Python function that achieves maximum code coverage. 
Include tests for:
1. Edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values, null/None)
2. Typical use cases (normal inputs and expected outputs)
3. Corner cases (minimum/maximum values, type boundaries)
4. All possible execution paths through the code
5. Full branch coverage for all if/else statements
6. Complete loop coverage for all loops
7. Error cases and exception handling

This suite covers all the mentioned scenarios:
1. Edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values, null/None)
2. Typical use cases (normal inputs and expected outputs)
3. Corner cases (minimum/maximum values, type boundaries)
4. All possible execution paths through the code
5. Full branch coverage for all if/else statements
6. Complete loop coverage for all loops
7. Error cases and exception handling
Please replace 'your_module' with the actual name of your module where the function is defined.
Also, this suite assumes that the function is implemented correctly. If there are any mistakes in the implementation of the function, these tests will fail.
Note: The test cases are written for the specific function implementation. If the function is modified in a way that changes the expected behavior of the function, the test cases should be updated accordingly.

This script covers all the test cases mentioned in the problem. It includes tests for:
1. Edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values, null/None)
2. Typical use cases (normal inputs and expected outputs)
3. Corner cases (minimum/maximum values, type boundaries)
4. All possible execution paths through the code
5. Full branch coverage for all if/else statements
6. Complete loop coverage for all loops
7. Error cases and exception handling
It also tests if the metadata is correctly set and the check function is working correctly. The script also invokes all test cases.
Please note that the script assumes that the function `below_zero` is defined in the same script as the test cases. If this is not the case, you will need to import the function into your script.

This suite of tests covers all the scenarios mentioned in the problem. It tests the function with typical input, edge cases, corner cases and some special scenarios.
In general, pytest is a powerful testing tool that can handle complex scenarios with ease. It allows you to write clear and concise tests, and runs them quickly. This makes it an excellent choice for testing Python code.

The above test cases are based on the function `fizz_buzz` which counts the number of times digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
The test suite includes:
- Edge cases: check if the function works correctly when the input is 0, 1, or negative number.
- Typical use cases: check if the function works correctly when the input is 100, 4000, or 100000.
- Corner cases: check if the function works correctly when the input is 10^1, 10^2, ..., 10^6.
- All possible execution paths: check if the function works correctly for all possible execution paths.
- Error cases: check if the function raises an exception when the input is 10^1, 10^2, ..., 10^6.
Please note that the above test cases are just a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would likely have more complex test cases to cover all possible edge cases and error conditions.

The function `add` is defined to take a list of integers as an argument. It sums the even elements that are at odd indices in the list. The test cases are designed to cover different scenarios including edge cases, typical use cases, corner cases, error cases, and exception handling.

Programming Assignment 4---**Author:** Shirin Rafiei**Total Points:** 100**Due:** 12:00 PM (Monday, 16 February)**Submission:** Submit your solutions in the form of a Jupyter notebook with .ipynb extension.**Instructions:** In this assignment, you will implement a version of the gradient descent algorithm. You will also implement a function to calculate the cost function given a set of weights.You will use these functions to find the optimal weights for a linear regression model.**Please Note:** You are not allowed to use any libraries other than Numpy (for all your calculations) and Matplotlib (for Visualization).**References:** Note: You may use any resources available online, including StackOverflow, and other educational resources. Please make sure to understand the concepts and resources you are using.

Task 1: Implement the Cost Function (15 points)**Note:** The cost function is used to evaluate how well the model is performing. It is a measure of how far the predictions are from the actual values. The formula for the cost function in linear regression is:$$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$$where:$h_{\theta}(x)$ is the hypothesis (our prediction)$\theta$ are the weights$x$ is the input$y$ is the actual output$m$ is the number of training examplesYou need to implement this function in Python.

Task 2: Implement the Gradient Descent Algorithm (15 points)**Note:** The gradient descent algorithm is an iterative approach to finding the minimum of a function. It involves starting with an initial guess for the minimum and iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent until we reach a point where the function is at its minimum.The update rule for the weights in the linear regression model is given by:$$\theta_j = \theta_j - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)}$$where:$\theta_j$ is the jth weight in the linear regression model$\alpha$ is the learning rate, which determines the step size during the update process.The algorithm stops when the difference between two successive cost values is less than a predefined threshold.You need to implement this function in Python.
